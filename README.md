# wikipediaSearchScript
Python script that lets you type in a search query and automatically pulls up Wikipedia pages on what you're searching for.
Just run the search script and type what you want to search. I find Wikipedia searches for information more useful than Google as of lately. It is more convenient for me to just run the script locally and type what I want to see than navigate using my web browser.
